I wouldn't replace all that time for anything else! I really wish I had met you earlier in my life, perhaps during my elementary school days in this school. But either way, meeting you and getting to know you so deeply made me experience so many things for the first time. My first hand held, the first time I could speak my feelings without feeling scared, the first person to have shown genuine care under my company, the first person who comes to mind every day, the first person to have loved me and nurtured me into such a better person, my first REAL lover. It was all a sudden blessing, and I'm so thankful for it.<br><br> I'm very thankful for you for making my life 100x better back to back and being so thoughtful to me every day! I hope you know nobody in my heart could replace you, and I hope that every night you get a random thought of me showing such affection with stupid words like 'Did you miss me?' or 'I love you my Coldhands.' All those stupid words of love that fill you with joy, hehehe. I will forever cherish this opportunity of asking you to be my Valentine because I've never actually done this before, and I'm so happy that my precious coldhandsss is my Valentine!! WAAAAA VERY HAPPY THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE CHANCE <33 I LOVE YOU VERY MUCH MY PRECIOUSSSSS";
